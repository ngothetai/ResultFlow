## Tips for Efficient Implementation

1. **Start with a minimal viable product (MVP)**
   - Focus on the core pipeline first
   - Add features incrementally
   - Get feedback early and often

2. **Use existing code smartly**
   - Your converter.py is a good starting point
   - Look for high-quality libraries rather than building everything
   - Consider using MongoDB Atlas for easier database management

3. **Test continuously**
   - Write tests alongside your code
   - Automate testing where possible
   - Validate each component independently

4. **Focus on error handling**
   - Medical data requires high accuracy
   - Implement robust validation
   - Add detailed logging for troubleshooting

5. **Use Streamlit's strengths**
   - Leverage the simplicity of Streamlit
   - Use session state for preserving user context
   - Utilize Streamlit caching for performance

6. **Parallelize work when possible**
   - Backend and frontend can be developed in parallel
   - Different team members can work on separate components
   - Use feature flags to integrate work gradually
