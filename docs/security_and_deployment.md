# Security and Deployment Guidelines

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

1. **Sensitive Data Handling**
   - Medical test results are classified as Protected Health Information (PHI)
   - All data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
   - Database should be properly secured with access controls
   - Implement data anonymization where possible for development environments

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Use strong, modern authentication methods (JWT tokens for admins)
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Admin login should require 2FA for enhanced security
   - Customer access uses short-lived tokens and one-time passwords
   - Enforce strong password policies for admin accounts

3. **Token Security**
   - Customer access tokens should be cryptographically secure
   - Implement proper token expiration (24 hours)
   - Use signed tokens to prevent tampering
   - Store token hashes, not the tokens themselves

4. **Transport Security**
   - Use TLS 1.3 for all HTTP traffic
   - Implement proper HTTP security headers:
     - Strict-Transport-Security
     - Content-Security-Policy
     - X-Content-Type-Options
     - X-Frame-Options
   - Validate all SSL/TLS certificates

5. **API Security**
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Use input validation on all endpoints
   - Apply the principle of least privilege to API access
   - Log all access attempts for auditing

### Compliance Considerations

1. **Medical Data Regulations**
   - Ensure compliance with relevant healthcare data regulations
   - Maintain audit trails of all data access
   - Implement proper data retention policies

2. **SMS Delivery**
   - Use reputable SMS providers with security certifications
   - Avoid sending PHI in SMS messages
   - Send only access links and passwords, not actual results

## Deployment Guidelines

### Development Environment

1. **Local Setup**
   - Use Docker for consistent development environments
   - Set up with docker-compose for local testing
   - Use environment variables for configuration
   - Sample data should be anonymized

2. **Version Control**
   - Use feature branches for development
   - Implement PR reviews before merging
   - Protect the main branch from direct commits
   - Use conventional commit messages

### Production Deployment

1. **Infrastructure Requirements**
   - Dedicated virtual machines or containers
   - Separate database server with proper backups
   - Load balancer for API servers
   - Separate worker nodes for the data pipeline
   - CDN for static assets

2. **Deployment Process**
   - Use CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
   - Implement blue-green deployment for zero downtime
   - Run database migrations separately from application deployment
   - Version all deployments for rollback capability

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Use environment variables for all configuration
   - Store secrets in a secure vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault)
   - Never commit secrets or environment files to version control
   - Use different configurations for dev/staging/production

4. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Implement centralized logging (ELK stack or similar)
   - Set up application performance monitoring
   - Configure alerts for system issues
   - Monitor SMS delivery rates and failures
   - Track database performance metrics

### Scaling Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - API servers should be stateless for easy scaling
   - Use a distributed task queue (Celery) for pipeline processing
   - Implement proper caching strategies

2. **Database Scaling**
   - Consider MongoDB sharding for large datasets
   - Implement proper indexes for performance
   - Set up read replicas if read load is high

3. **File Storage**
   - Consider external object storage for files as volume grows
   - Set up proper backup and retention policies

## Disaster Recovery

1. **Backup Strategy**
   - Daily database backups
   - Regular file storage backups
   - Offsite backup storage
   - Periodic recovery testing

2. **High Availability**
   - Deploy in multiple availability zones if possible
   - Implement database replication
   - Set up automated failover

3. **Recovery Plans**
   - Document detailed recovery procedures
   - Set Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)
   - Set Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)
   - Conduct regular recovery drills

## Maintenance Procedures

1. **Regular Updates**
   - Schedule regular maintenance windows
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Apply security patches promptly

2. **Performance Tuning**
   - Regular review of database indexes
   - Optimize slow API endpoints
   - Review and optimize file storage
